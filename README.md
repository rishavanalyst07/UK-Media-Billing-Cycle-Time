# UK-Media-Billing-Cycle-Time

Description - The project aims to analyze how long it takes for billing to happen after a media campaign runs, and identify delays or inefficiencies in the process.

1. Analyzed three key KPIs: Media Air Date → Client Bill Creation, Vendor Invoice Date → Invoice Receipt, and Invoice Receipt → Invoice Booking to measure end-to-end billing efficiency.
2. Designed delay bucket analysis (0–30, 31–60, 61–90, 90+ days) to identify billing bottlenecks, overdue invoices, and process gaps.
3. Built vendor-level performance visuals to highlight high-delay vendors impacting overall billing cycle time.
4. Delivered transaction-level visibility for Finance and Media teams to support invoice follow-ups, cash-flow monitoring, and payment prioritization.
